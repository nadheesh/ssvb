# Streaming Stochastic Variational Bayes (SSVB)

## Experiments

Contains the experiment scripts from the paper "Streaming stochastic variational Bayes; An improved approach for Bayesian inference with data streams"
preprint (version1) - https://peerj.com/manuscripts/38413/

Three experiment scripts; 

- SVB (Broderick et al., 2013) with black-box inference primitives vs SVI (Hoffman et al., 2013) as black-box inference
- SSVB for classification (vs SVB, SVI and PVI) 
- SSVB for linear mixed-effects models (vs SVB, SVI and PVI)
